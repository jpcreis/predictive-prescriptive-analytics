# Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics for Laser Seam Welding

This repository presents the implementation of a predictive model for product quality based on machine parameters in a laser seam welding process. Additionally, a prescriptive model was developed using meta-heuristic algorithms to find the best machine parameter once a new product quality is required.

For all the code snippets and plots please open the Jupyter Notebook named "predictive_prescriptive_analytics.ipynb". The folder dataset contains all the relevant CSVs, including the original dataset and post-processed ones. For the presented scenario, the dataset label as "no_keyhole" was used.
